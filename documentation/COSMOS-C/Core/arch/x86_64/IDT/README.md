# 🧩 IDT Folder Documentation

## 📁 Folder Overview

The **`IDT/`** folder in the kernel source contains the implementation of the  
**Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)** — a crucial structure that tells the CPU  
how to handle exceptions, traps, and hardware interrupts.

In COSMOS-C, this folder contains **two files**:

**`IDT/`**

- **idt.c** - Implementation of IDT setup and management
- **idt.h** - Header file defining IDT structures and declarations
