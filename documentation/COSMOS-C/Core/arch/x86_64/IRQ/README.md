# ‚ö° `IRQ/` ‚Äî Interrupt Request Handling Module

## üìÅ Folder Overview

The **`IRQ/`** directory contains all source files responsible for **handling hardware interrupts (IRQs)** in the operating system kernel.  
It works together with the **IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)** and **PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller)** subsystems to route and manage interrupt signals from external hardware devices such as the keyboard, timer, and disk controllers.

---

## üß† Purpose

In x86 architecture, **hardware devices** signal the CPU using **IRQ lines (Interrupt Requests)**.  
Each IRQ corresponds to an interrupt vector in the **IDT**, starting at vector **32** (after remapping the PIC).

For example:

| Device | IRQ Line | IDT Vector |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| System Timer (PIT) | 0 | 32 |
| Keyboard | 1 | 33 |
| Cascade (Slave PIC) | 2 | 34 |
| COM2 / COM4 | 3 | 35 |
| COM1 / COM3 | 4 | 36 |
| Floppy Disk | 6 | 38 |
| Real-Time Clock | 8 | 40 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Responsibilities

The IRQ subsystem manages:
1. **Remapping the PIC** ‚Äî to move IRQs away from CPU exceptions (0‚Äì31 ‚Üí reserved by CPU).
2. **Setting up IDT entries (vectors 32‚Äì47)** ‚Äî linking them to low-level interrupt service routines (ISRs).
3. **Dispatching interrupts** ‚Äî calling the correct device driver or handler function.
4. **Acknowledging interrupts** ‚Äî sending End Of Interrupt (EOI) signals to the PIC after handling.
5. **Enabling/disabling IRQs** dynamically ‚Äî depending on device state or kernel mode.

## üîÑ Flow of a Hardware Interrupt
Device ‚Üí PIC ‚Üí CPU ‚Üí IDT Entry ‚Üí ISR Stub (isr.asm)

1. Hardware device triggers an IRQ.
2. PIC sends an interrupt signal to the CPU.
3. CPU jumps to the corresponding **IDT entry (32‚Äì47)**.
4. ISR stub (from `isr.asm`) calls the C-level special function.
5. The IRQ subsystem executes the appropriate handler function.
6. The interrupt is acknowledged with **EOI** to the PIC.

## üß© Integration with Other Subsystems
| Subsystem       | Role                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **IDT**         | Maps IRQ vectors to ISR stubs.                 |
| **PIC**         | Handles low-level routing and acknowledgement. |
| **PS/2 Driver** | Uses IRQ1 (keyboard).                          |
| **PIT Driver**  | Uses IRQ0 (system timer).                      |

## ‚úÖ Summary
| Component   | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `irq.c`     | Core IRQ handling logic (initialization, dispatch, EOI). |
| `irq.h`     | Declarations and constants for IRQ system.               |
| IRQ vectors | 32‚Äì47 (mapped from PIC hardware lines).                  |
| Integration | Works with IDT + PIC to manage hardware interrupts.      |

‚öôÔ∏è The `IRQ` module forms the bridge between **hardware devices** and the **kernel**, allowing real-time responses to external events like keyboard input, timers, and system calls.
